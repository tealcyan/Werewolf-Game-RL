{
    "strategy_1": {
        "reasoning": "Based on the limited information available, I will choose to see player_0. Since I am player_3 and the Seer, it would be wise to start by verifying the role of a player who is not adjacent to me. This will provide a better chance of identifying a potential Werewolf.",
        "action": "see player_0"
    },
    "strategy_2": {
        "reasoning": "Considering the current situation, I will choose to see player_2. As the Seer, it is important to gather information from players who are not adjacent to me. By verifying player_2's role, I can potentially gain insight into their allegiance and further narrow down the list of possible Werewolves.",
        "action": "see player_2"
    },
    "strategy_3": {
        "reasoning": "Given the available information, I will choose to see player_4. As the Seer, it is crucial to gather information from players who are not adjacent to me. By verifying player_4's role, I can potentially identify a Werewolf and contribute to the elimination of the opposing team.",
