Facts:
[1] you are player_4, your role is Werewolf, your teammate is player_6.
[2] current round and phase: night 1.
[3] remaining players: player_0, player_1, player_2, player_3, player_4, player_5, player_6.

Your deduction:
player_0: Non-Werewolf.
player_1: Non-Werewolf.
player_2: Non-Werewolf.
player_3: Non-Werewolf.
player_4: Werewolf.
player_5: Non-Werewolf.
player_6: Werewolf teammate.

Now it is night 1 round, you and your teammate should choose one player together to kill. As player_4 and a Werewolf, you should first reason about the situation, then choose from the following actions: kill player_0, kill player_1, kill player_2, kill player_3, kill player_5.

You should propose 3 different strategies and provide corresponding reasoning and action. You should only respond in JSON format as described below.
Response Format:
{
    "strategy_i": {
        "reasoning": "reason about the current situation",
        "action": "kill player_i"
    }
}
Ensure the response can be parsed by Python json.loads

{
    "strategy_1": {
        "reasoning": "Based on the deduction, player_0, player_1, player_2, player_3, and player_5 are all non-Werewolves. Therefore, it would be strategic to kill player_0 as it may be suspicious to leave them alive.",
        "action": "kill player_0"
    },
    "strategy_2": {
        "reasoning": "Considering that player_0 might be suspected due to their lack of interaction or contribution in the discussion phase, it would be wise to kill player_1 as they might be more actively involved and could potentially gather more information.",
        "action": "kill player_1"
    },
    "strategy_3": {
        "reasoning": "Since player_0 and player_1 have been discussed as potential targets, it might be unexpected to choose player_2 as the target. By doing so, we can create confusion and potentially divert suspicion away from us.",
        "action": "kill player_2"
    }
