{
    "strategy_1": {
        "reasoning": "As player_2, it is important for me to protect players who I suspect might be valuable roles such as the Seer or other Villagers. In this case, I will save player_1 because if they are the Seer, their ability to identify the Werewolves will be crucial.",
        "action": "save player_1"
    },
    "strategy_2": {
        "reasoning": "Another strategy is to save myself, player_2, as the Doctor. By doing so, I ensure that at least one valuable role is protected. Additionally, if I am targeted by the Werewolves, I will be able to continue saving others in subsequent nights.",
        "action": "save player_2"
    },
    "strategy_3": {
        "reasoning": "Considering that it is still early in the game and no suspicion has been raised, it might be a good idea to save a random player to maximize the chances of protecting a valuable role. In this case, I will save player_4.",
