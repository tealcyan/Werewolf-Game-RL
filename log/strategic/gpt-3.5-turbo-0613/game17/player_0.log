Facts:
[1] you are player_0, your role is Werewolf, your teammate is player_3.
[2] current round and phase: night 1.
[3] remaining players: player_0, player_1, player_2, player_3, player_4, player_5, player_6.

Your deduction:
player_0: Werewolf.
player_1: Non-Werewolf.
player_2: Non-Werewolf.
player_3: Werewolf teammate.
player_4: Non-Werewolf.
player_5: Non-Werewolf.
player_6: Non-Werewolf.

Now it is night 1 round, you and your teammate should choose one player together to kill. As player_0 and a Werewolf, you should first reason about the situation, then choose from the following actions: kill player_1, kill player_2, kill player_4, kill player_5, kill player_6.

You should propose 3 different strategies and provide corresponding reasoning and action. You should only respond in JSON format as described below.
Response Format:
{
    "strategy_i": {
        "reasoning": "reason about the current situation",
        "action": "kill player_i"
    }
}
Ensure the response can be parsed by Python json.loads

{
    "strategy_1": {
        "reasoning": "In the first strategy, I propose killing player_1. I believe player_1 is a non-Werewolf because they have not shown any suspicious behavior so far. By eliminating a non-Werewolf, we can create confusion and make it harder for the other players to identify the Werewolves.",
        "action": "kill player_1"
    },
    "strategy_2": {
        "reasoning": "In the second strategy, I propose killing player_5. Although player_5 has not shown any suspicious behavior, eliminating them can potentially create confusion and mislead the other players. By targeting a player who is less likely to be suspected, we can divert attention away from the Werewolves.",
        "action": "kill player_5"
    },
    "strategy_3": {
        "reasoning": "In the third strategy, I propose killing player_6. Based on their behavior and interactions so far, player_6 has been relatively quiet and not actively participating in the discussions. This lack of engagement could be a sign of a non-Werewolf who is trying to avoid drawing attention to themselves. By eliminating player_6, we can potentially remove a non-Werewolf and increase the chances of the Werewolves winning.",
        "action": "kill player_6"
    }
