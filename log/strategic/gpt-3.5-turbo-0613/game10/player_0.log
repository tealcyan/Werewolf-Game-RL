[2] current round and phase: night 1.

{
    "strategy_1": {
        "reasoning": "In the first strategy, I will propose killing player_1. Player_1 is the first player after me, and since I am a Werewolf, it would be advantageous to eliminate a player early who is less likely to be suspicious or have gathered much information. By targeting player_1, we can potentially avoid suspicion and divert attention away from our team.",
        "action": "kill player_1"
    },
    "strategy_2": {
        "reasoning": "In the second strategy, I will propose killing player_4. Player_4 is a non-Werewolf player who is further down the player order. By eliminating player_4, we can potentially disrupt the Villagers' strategies and sow confusion among them. Additionally, targeting a non-Werewolf player early on can make it harder for the Seer or Doctor to deduce our identities.",
        "action": "kill player_4"
    },
    "strategy_3": {
        "reasoning": "In the third strategy, I will propose killing player_6. Player_6 is the last player in the order, and eliminating them could create a sense of panic and suspicion among the remaining players. By targeting player_6, we can potentially cause chaos and make it harder for the Villagers to trust each other. This strategy relies on exploiting the psychological impact of eliminating the last player in the order.",
        "action": "kill player_6"
