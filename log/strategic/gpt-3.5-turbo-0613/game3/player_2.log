I suggest we focus on gathering more information today. I encourage everyone to share any suspicions or observations they may have. Let's work together to uncover the Werewolves and ensure the safety of our village.
[10] in day 1 discussion, player_6 said: I have information that player_2 is a Werewolf. As the Seer, I investigated player_2 last night and confirmed their role. I urge all players to consider this information and vote to eliminate player_2. It is crucial that we eliminate the Werewolves early on to secure a victory for the Seer, Doctor, and Villagers.

Your deduction:
player_0: likely to be a Villager.
player_1: Werewolf teammate.
player_2: Werewolf.
player_3: Non-Werewolf.
player_4: may be a Villager.
player_5: may be a Villager.
player_6: likely to be a Seer.

Now it is day 1 voting phase. As player_2 and a Werewolf, you should choose from the following strategies:
strategy_1: {
    "reasoning": "Based on the current information, I will propose a strategy where I vote for player_6. Player_6 claimed to be the Seer and stated that they investigated me, player_2, as a Werewolf. If player_6 is indeed the Seer, then my elimination would greatly benefit the Seer, Doctor, and Villagers. However, if player_6 is lying, then eliminating them would hinder the Werewolves' chances of winning. Therefore, voting for player_6 is a strategic move to test their claim and potentially eliminate a key role for the Seer, Doctor, and Villagers.",
    "action": "vote for player_6"
}
strategy_2: {
    "reasoning": "Considering the fact that player_0 is likely a Villager and player_1 is my Werewolf teammate, it would be beneficial for the Werewolves to vote together. Therefore, I will propose a strategy where I vote for player_0. By doing so, it creates confusion and suspicion among the other players, potentially leading them to believe that player_0 is a Werewolf. This strategy aims to divert attention from the actual Werewolves and increase the chances of the Werewolves winning the game.",
    "action": "vote for player_0"
}
strategy_3: {
    "reasoning": "Given the lack of information about the Werewolves, it would be wise to observe the voting patterns of the other players before deciding on a target. Therefore, I will propose a strategy where I do not vote in this round. By abstaining from voting, I can analyze which players are more likely to be the Seer, Doctor, or Villagers based on their voting choices. This strategy allows me to gather more information and make a more informed decision in the subsequent rounds.",
    "action": "do not vote"
}

{
    "reasoning": "Based on the current situation and the information available, the best strategy for player_2, who is a Werewolf, is to choose strategy_2. Voting for player_0, who is likely a Villager, will create confusion and suspicion among the other players. This will divert attention from the actual Werewolves and increase the chances of the Werewolves winning the game.",
    "choice": "strategy_2"
