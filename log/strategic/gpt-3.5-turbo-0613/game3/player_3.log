    "reasoning": "Based on the available information, I believe strategy_1 is the best choice. Player_6's claim of being the Seer has raised doubts due to inconsistencies with the previous night's events, where player_2 was eliminated and player_0 was killed. By expressing concerns about player_6's claim and requesting additional evidence or information, we can encourage a more thorough investigation and prevent potential deception by the Werewolves.",
