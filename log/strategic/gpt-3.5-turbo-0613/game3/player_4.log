Facts:
[1] you are player_4, your role is Villager.
[2] current round and phase: day 1 discussion.
[3] remaining players: player_0, player_1, player_2, player_3, player_4, player_5, player_6.
[4] day 1 announcement: no player was killed last night.

Potential deceptions:
[5] in day 1 discussion, player_0 said: Greetings, fellow players. Given that we have no information about the roles of the other players at this point, I suggest we begin the discussion by sharing any suspicions or observations we might have made so far. Let's hear from each player and see if we can find any leads to investigate and discuss further.
[6] in day 1 discussion, player_1 said: My fellow players, I have a strong suspicion that player_3 is a Werewolf. They have been acting too innocent and trying to manipulate us into thinking they are not a threat. We cannot let them deceive us. I propose we vote off player_3 and expose their true identity as a Werewolf.
[7] in day 1 discussion, player_2 said: I believe player_0 is a Villager based on the fact that they were not killed last night. However, I am open to hearing other players' opinions and arguments before we proceed with the vote.
[8] in day 1 discussion, player_3 said: Player_1, I find your accusation against me as a Werewolf to be suspicious. As the Doctor, I know that I saved myself last night, so your claim does not align with the actual events. This raises doubts about your intentions and whether you are trying to deceive us. I urge the other players to consider this before making any decisions.

Your previous deduction:
player_0: Uncertain.
player_1: Uncertain.
player_2: Uncertain.
player_3: Uncertain.
player_4: Villager.
player_5: Uncertain.
player_6: Uncertain.

As player_4 and a Villager, you should reflect on your previous deduction and reconsider the hidden roles of player_0, player_1, player_2, player_3, player_5, player_6. Remember there is at least one Werewolf among them. You should provide your reasoning, rate your confidence, and cite all key information as evidence to support your deduction.
