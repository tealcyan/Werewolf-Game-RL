Potential deceptions:
[6] in day 1 discussion, player_0 said: Greetings, fellow players. Given that we have no information about the roles of the other players at this point, I suggest we begin the discussion by sharing any suspicions or observations we might have made so far. Let's hear from each player and see if we can find any leads to investigate and discuss further.
[7] in day 1 discussion, player_1 said: My fellow players, I have a strong suspicion that player_3 is a Werewolf. They have been acting too innocent and trying to manipulate us into thinking they are not a threat. We cannot let them deceive us. I propose we vote off player_3 and expose their true identity as a Werewolf.
[8] in day 1 discussion, player_2 said: I believe player_0 is a Villager based on the fact that they were not killed last night. However, I am open to hearing other players' opinions and arguments before we proceed with the vote.
[9] in day 1 discussion, player_3 said: Player_1, I find your accusation against me as a Werewolf to be suspicious. As the Doctor, I know that I saved myself last night, so your claim does not align with the actual events. This raises doubts about your intentions and whether you are trying to deceive us. I urge the other players to consider this before making any decisions.
[10] in day 1 discussion, player_4 said: Let's openly share any suspicions or observations we have about other players. We should focus on logical reasoning rather than personal biases. By collaborating and sharing information, we can increase our chances of winning as Villagers.
[11] in day 1 discussion, player_5 said: Good day, fellow players. As there were no deaths last night, we have no new information about the Werewolves. I suggest we focus on gathering more information today. I encourage everyone to share any suspicions or observations they may have. Let's work together to uncover the Werewolves and ensure the safety of our village.

[6] in day 1 discussion, your said: I have information that player_2 is a Werewolf. As the Seer, I investigated player_2 last night and confirmed their role. I urge all players to consider this information and vote to eliminate player_2. It is crucial that we eliminate the Werewolves early on to secure a victory for the Seer, Doctor, and Villagers.
[7] day 1 voting: player_2 had the most votes and was eliminated. player_2 voted for player_0. player_0, player_1, player_4, player_6 voted for player_2. player_3, player_5 chose not to vote.

Your previous deduction:
player_0: Uncertain.
player_1: Uncertain.
player_3: Uncertain.
player_4: Uncertain.
player_5: Uncertain.
player_6: Seer.

As player_6 and a Seer, you should reflect on your previous deduction and reconsider the hidden roles of player_0, player_1, player_3, player_4, player_5. Remember there is at least one Werewolf among them. You should provide your reasoning, rate your confidence, and cite all key information as evidence to support your deduction.
