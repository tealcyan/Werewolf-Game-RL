[2] current round and phase: night 1.

You should propose 3 different strategies and provide corresponding reasoning and action. You should only respond in JSON format as described below.

{
    "strategy_1": {
        "reasoning": "player_0 and player_1 are both non-Werewolves, so it would be safer to kill one of them in order to confuse the other players. By doing so, they may suspect each other and divert attention away from the actual Werewolves. Therefore, we should kill player_0.",
        "action": "kill player_0"
    },
    "strategy_2": {
        "reasoning": "player_3, player_5, and player_6 are all non-Werewolves, but they may have the potential to be valuable roles like the Seer or the Doctor. By eliminating one of them, we can reduce the chances of the Villagers having assistance in identifying or protecting themselves against the Werewolves. Therefore, we should kill player_3.",
        "action": "kill player_3"
    },
    "strategy_3": {
        "reasoning": "player_1 is less likely to be suspected as a Werewolf since player_0 is more suspicious. By killing player_1, we can create doubt among the remaining players and potentially lead them to suspect player_0 even more. This strategy can help us in later rounds to manipulate the Villagers' suspicions. Therefore, we should kill player_1.",
        "action": "kill player_1"
