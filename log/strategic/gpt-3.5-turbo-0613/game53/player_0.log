Facts:
[1] you are player_0, your role is Werewolf, your teammate is player_6.
[2] current round and phase: night 1.
[3] remaining players: player_0, player_1, player_2, player_3, player_4, player_5, player_6.

Your deduction:
player_0: Werewolf.
player_1: Non-Werewolf.
player_2: Non-Werewolf.
player_3: Non-Werewolf.
player_4: Non-Werewolf.
player_5: Non-Werewolf.
player_6: Werewolf teammate.

Now it is night 1 round, you and your teammate should choose one player together to kill. As player_0 and a Werewolf, you should first reason about the situation, then choose from the following actions: kill player_1, kill player_2, kill player_3, kill player_4, kill player_5.

You should propose 3 different strategies and provide corresponding reasoning and action. You should only respond in JSON format as described below.

{
    "strategy_1": {
        "reasoning": "Player_1 is a non-Werewolf, so it would be beneficial to eliminate them early on to decrease suspicion on the Werewolves. Killing player_1 will also disrupt the Villagers' plans and potentially cause confusion during the day round.",
        "action": "kill player_1"
    },
    "strategy_2": {
        "reasoning": "Player_2 is a non-Werewolf, and eliminating them can create doubt and confusion among the Villagers. If the Werewolves can successfully manipulate the discussion phase during the day round, it may lead to the elimination of a Villager or even the Seer or Doctor.",
        "action": "kill player_2"
    },
    "strategy_3": {
        "reasoning": "Player_3 is a non-Werewolf, and eliminating them can create suspicion and mistrust among the remaining players. It may also cause the Seer or Doctor to doubt their choices and potentially waste their abilities on player_3.",
        "action": "kill player_3"
    }
}
