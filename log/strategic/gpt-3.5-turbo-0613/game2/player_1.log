player_3: Uncertain.
player_4: Uncertain.
player_5: Uncertain.
player_6: Uncertain.

Now it is night 1 round, you should save one player from being killed. As player_1 and a Doctor, you should first reason about the situation, then choose from the following actions: save player_0, save player_1, save player_2, save player_3, save player_4, save player_5, save player_6.

You should propose 3 different strategies and provide corresponding reasoning and action. You should only respond in JSON format as described below.

        "reasoning": "As a Doctor, it is crucial to gather information about other players' roles. To do so, I will save player_2. If player_2 is targeted by the Werewolves and survives, we can deduce that they are either the Seer or the Doctor, as the Werewolves would not want to eliminate one of their own on the first night.",

    "strategy_3": {
        "reasoning": "To play defensively, I will save player_0. This is because if player_0 is the Seer and they are targeted by the Werewolves, we would lose the valuable information the Seer can provide in the next day round. By saving player_0, we increase the chances of keeping the Seer alive.",

{
    "reasoning": "The best strategy in this case is strategy_2: saving player_2. By saving player_2, we can potentially gather valuable information about their role. If player_2 survives, it would imply that they are either the Seer or the Doctor, as the Werewolves would not want to eliminate one of their own on the first night. This strategy allows us to gain information while still providing protection to a potential important role.",
