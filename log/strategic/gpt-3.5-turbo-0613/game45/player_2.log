{
    "strategy_1": {
        "reasoning": "Since it is the first night round and no information is available yet, it is difficult to make an informed decision. In this case, I will save myself (player_2) as a precautionary measure.",
        "action": "save player_2"
    },
    "strategy_2": {
        "reasoning": "As a Doctor, I can try to save player_0. It is a random choice, but saving player_0 might be beneficial if they turn out to be a crucial role like the Seer or a Villager who is trusted by others.",
        "action": "save player_0"
    },
    "strategy_3": {
        "reasoning": "Since there is no information available, I can choose to save player_1. This choice is purely random but can help build trust with another player.",
