{
    "strategy_1": {
        "reasoning": "Since it is the first night round and no information about the other players' roles is available, a safe strategy would be to save myself (player_0). This ensures that there is at least one player guaranteed to be alive in the next day round.",
        "action": "save player_0"
    },
    "strategy_2": {
        "reasoning": "Considering that player_1 and player_2 are the closest players to player_0, it might be beneficial to save one of them to establish a potential alliance or gain their trust. This can help gather information and potentially identify the Werewolves in the upcoming rounds.",
        "action": "save player_1"
    },
    "strategy_3": {
        "reasoning": "As the Doctor, it is important to consider the probability of the other players being targeted by the Werewolves. Assuming the Werewolves might target player_0, it might be wise to save player_2, who is the next closest player. This way, if the Werewolves do target player_0, the Doctor's save action would not be wasted.",
        "action": "save player_2"
    }
