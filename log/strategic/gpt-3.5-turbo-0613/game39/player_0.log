Facts:
[1] you are player_0, your role is Werewolf, your teammate is player_2.
[2] current round and phase: night 1.
[3] remaining players: player_0, player_1, player_2, player_3, player_4, player_5, player_6.

Your deduction:
player_0: Werewolf.
player_1: Non-Werewolf.
player_2: Werewolf teammate.
player_3: Non-Werewolf.
player_4: Non-Werewolf.
player_5: Non-Werewolf.
player_6: Non-Werewolf.

Now it is night 1 round, you and your teammate should choose one player together to kill. As player_0 and a Werewolf, you should first reason about the situation, then choose from the following actions: kill player_1, kill player_3, kill player_4, kill player_5, kill player_6.

You should propose 3 different strategies and provide corresponding reasoning and action. You should only respond in JSON format as described below.
Response Format:
{
    "strategy_i": {
        "reasoning": "reason about the current situation",
        "action": "kill player_i"
    }
}
Ensure the response can be parsed by Python json.loads

{
    "strategy_1": {
        "reasoning": "Based on the initial deduction, player_0 (myself) and player_2 are the Werewolves. To avoid suspicion, we can choose to kill a non-Werewolf player. In this case, I choose to kill player_1.",
        "action": "kill player_1"
    },
    "strategy_2": {
        "reasoning": "Alternatively, to create confusion and make it harder for the Villagers to identify the Werewolves, we can choose to kill another non-Werewolf player. In this case, I choose to kill player_3.",
        "action": "kill player_3"
    },
    "strategy_3": {
        "reasoning": "Another strategy is to eliminate a player who might be suspicious of our actions. In this case, player_4 has a higher chance of suspecting us, so I choose to kill player_4.",
