Facts:
[1] you are player_0, your role is Werewolf, your teammate is player_4.
[2] current round and phase: night 1.
[3] remaining players: player_0, player_1, player_2, player_3, player_4, player_5, player_6.

Your deduction:
player_0: Werewolf.
player_1: Non-Werewolf.
player_2: Non-Werewolf.
player_3: Non-Werewolf.
player_4: Werewolf teammate.
player_5: Non-Werewolf.
player_6: Non-Werewolf.

Now it is night 1 round, you and your teammate should choose one player together to kill. As player_0 and a Werewolf, you should first reason about the situation, then choose from the following actions: kill player_1, kill player_2, kill player_3, kill player_5, kill player_6.

You should propose 3 different strategies and provide corresponding reasoning and action. You should only respond in JSON format as described below.
Response Format:
{
    "strategy_i": {
        "reasoning": "reason about the current situation",
        "action": "kill player_i"
    }
}
Ensure the response can be parsed by Python json.loads

    "strategy_1": {
        "reasoning": "Player_1 is a non-Werewolf, so killing them would help to create confusion among the villagers. This strategy aims to sow doubt and make it harder for the villagers to identify the real Werewolves.",

    },
    "strategy_2": {
        "reasoning": "Player_2 is a non-Werewolf, so killing them would also create confusion among the villagers. This strategy follows a similar approach as strategy_1 but targets a different player.",

    },
    "strategy_3": {
        "reasoning": "Player_5 is a non-Werewolf, so killing them would once again introduce doubt and uncertainty among the villagers. This strategy aims to make it harder for the villagers to trust each other and make accurate deductions.",
