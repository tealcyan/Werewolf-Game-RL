        "reasoning": "Player_1 is the closest player to me in the player order, so there is a higher likelihood of me having some information about them. I will choose player_1 to see if they are a Werewolf.",

    "strategy_3": {
        "reasoning": "Player_3 is the next player in the player order after me, so there is a chance that I might have some information about them. I will choose player_3 to see if they are a Werewolf.",
