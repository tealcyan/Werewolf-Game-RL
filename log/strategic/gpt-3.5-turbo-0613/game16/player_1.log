{
    "strategy_1": {
        "reasoning": "In the first strategy, I will choose to see player_0. Since player_0 is the first player in the game, they have the highest chance of being a Werewolf. By seeing player_0, I can gather information about their role and potentially identify if they are a Werewolf.",
        "action": "see player_0"
    },
    "strategy_2": {
        "reasoning": "In the second strategy, I will choose to see player_2. By selecting a player who is not adjacent to me (player_1), I can potentially gather more diverse information about the roles of players. This can help broaden the possibilities and narrow down the potential Werewolves.",
        "action": "see player_2"
    },
    "strategy_3": {
        "reasoning": "In the third strategy, I will choose to see player_3. Although player_3 is adjacent to me, it is important to gather information about players who are closer in order to establish a stronger basis for accusation or defense. By seeing player_3, I can potentially uncover their role and compare it to the actions and behaviors exhibited so far.",
        "action": "see player_3"
    }
