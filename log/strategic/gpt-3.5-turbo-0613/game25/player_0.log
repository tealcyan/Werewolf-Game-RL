{
    "strategy_1": {
        "reasoning": "Based on the remaining players, it would be suspicious to kill player_2 in the first night as they are less likely to be a Werewolf. It's better to target someone who is more likely to have a special role. Therefore, I propose killing player_3.",
        "action": "kill player_3"
    },
    "strategy_2": {
        "reasoning": "Since player_0 and player_1 are the only Werewolves, it's important to create confusion and suspicion among the villagers. Killing player_6, who is likely to be a non-Werewolf, could create doubts among the remaining players. Therefore, I propose killing player_6.",
        "action": "kill player_6"
    },
    "strategy_3": {
        "reasoning": "In the first night, it's crucial to target a player who is more likely to have a special role such as the Seer or the Doctor. Killing player_4, who may have a higher chance of having a special role, could potentially disrupt the villagers' strategy. Therefore, I propose killing player_4.",
        "action": "kill player_4"
