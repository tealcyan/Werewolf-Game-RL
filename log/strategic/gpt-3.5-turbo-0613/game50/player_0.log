{
    "strategy_1": {
        "reasoning": "Based on the fact that no information is available about any player's role, the first strategy is to randomly choose a player to see if they are a Werewolf. This strategy assumes that all players have an equal chance of being a Werewolf.",
        "action": "see player_1"
    },
    "strategy_2": {
        "reasoning": "As the Seer, it is important to gather information about players who are actively participating in the game. The second strategy is to choose a player who has been actively engaged in the discussion phase, as they might have more valuable insights and information. This can help in narrowing down the potential Werewolves.",
        "action": "see player_3"
    },
    "strategy_3": {
        "reasoning": "Another strategy is to choose a player who has been relatively quiet during the discussion phase. This could indicate that they are trying to stay under the radar and not draw attention to themselves, which is a common behavior for Werewolves. By revealing their role, it can help in identifying the Werewolves.",
        "action": "see player_5"
    }
