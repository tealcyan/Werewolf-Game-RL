{
    "strategy_1": {
        "reasoning": "Since it is the first night and we have no information about the other players' roles, it would be best to prioritize saving myself, player_6. As the Doctor, I can protect myself and ensure my survival in case the Werewolves target me.",
        "action": "save player_6"
    },
    "strategy_2": {
        "reasoning": "Considering that there are no concrete suspicions or information available, it might be wise to save a player who is more likely to be a Villager. Based on the assumption that the Werewolves might try to eliminate a Seer or Doctor, I will save player_3. This way, there is a chance of protecting a valuable role.",
        "action": "save player_3"
    },
    "strategy_3": {
        "reasoning": "Since it is the first night and there are no concrete leads, it might be beneficial to save a player at random. Saving player_2 would be a random choice, as there is no specific reason to believe they are more suspicious than other players. This strategy aims to maintain balance and increase the chances of protecting a Villager or important role.",
