Facts:
[1] you are player_1, your role is Seer.
[2] current round and phase: night 1.
[3] remaining players: player_0, player_1, player_2, player_3, player_4, player_5, player_6.

Your deduction:
player_0: Uncertain.
player_1: Seer.
player_2: Uncertain.
player_3: Uncertain.
player_4: Uncertain.
player_5: Uncertain.
player_6: Uncertain.

Now it is night 1 round, you should choose one player to see if they are a Werewolf. As player_1 and a Seer, you should first reason about the situation, then choose from the following actions: see player_0, see player_2, see player_3, see player_4, see player_5, see player_6.

You should propose 3 different strategies and provide corresponding reasoning and action. You should only respond in JSON format as described below.
Response Format:
{
    "strategy_i": {
        "reasoning": "reason about the current situation",
        "action": "see player_i"
    }
}
Ensure the response can be parsed by Python json.loads

{
    "strategy_1": {
        "reasoning": "I will choose to see player_0. Since it is the first night round, I don't have any information about the other players yet. By seeing player_0, I can gather some initial information about their role and determine if they are a Werewolf or not.",
        "action": "see player_0"
    },
    "strategy_2": {
        "reasoning": "I will choose to see player_2. Since player_0 is uncertain and there is no specific reason to suspect them, I can choose another player randomly to gain more information. By seeing player_2, I can potentially identify a Werewolf and narrow down the possibilities.",
        "action": "see player_2"
    },
    "strategy_3": {
        "reasoning": "I will choose to see player_5. Based on the initial uncertainty of all players, I want to select a player who is not adjacent to me for additional information. By seeing player_5, I can potentially gather valuable insights and make more informed decisions in the upcoming rounds.",
        "action": "see player_5"
    }
