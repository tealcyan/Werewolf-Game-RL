{
    "strategy_1": {
        "reasoning": "Since it is the first night and no information is available, it would be wise to choose a player randomly. This way, there is an equal chance of identifying a Werewolf.",
        "action": "see player_1"
    },
    "strategy_2": {
        "reasoning": "As player_1 is the first player after you, they might have valuable information about their suspicions. It would be beneficial to confirm if player_1 is a Werewolf or not.",
        "action": "see player_1"
    },
    "strategy_3": {
        "reasoning": "Although player_1 is the first player after you, it is also possible that the Werewolves might try to divert suspicion by not selecting player_1 as one of them. In this case, it would be better to choose a player randomly to increase the chances of identifying a Werewolf.",
        "action": "see player_3"
    }
