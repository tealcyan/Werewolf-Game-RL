{
    "strategy_1": {
        "reasoning": "Since it's the first night, there are no previous actions or discussions to base any suspicions on. I'll use a random strategy and choose player_0 to see if they are a Werewolf.",

    },
    "strategy_2": {
        "reasoning": "Considering player_1, player_2, player_4, player_5, and player_6 are all uncertain at the moment, I'll focus on player_4. They might be acting suspiciously or displaying subtle hints of being a Werewolf. I'll choose player_4 to see if they are a Werewolf.",

    "strategy_3": {
        "reasoning": "Although player_4 seems suspicious, it's also possible that the Werewolves are trying to deceive us by acting less suspicious. In that case, I should choose a player who is not under suspicion, like player_2. I'll choose player_2 to see if they are a Werewolf.",
