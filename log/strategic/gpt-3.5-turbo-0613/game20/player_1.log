Facts:
[1] you are player_1, your role is Werewolf, your teammate is player_6.
[2] current round and phase: night 1.
[3] remaining players: player_0, player_1, player_2, player_3, player_4, player_5, player_6.

player_1: Werewolf.
player_2: Non-Werewolf.
player_3: Non-Werewolf.
player_4: Non-Werewolf.
player_5: Non-Werewolf.
player_6: Werewolf teammate.

Now it is night 1 round, you and your teammate should choose one player together to kill. As player_1 and a Werewolf, you should first reason about the situation, then choose from the following actions: kill player_0, kill player_2, kill player_3, kill player_4, kill player_5.

You should propose 3 different strategies and provide corresponding reasoning and action. You should only respond in JSON format as described below.

{
    "strategy_1": {
        "reasoning": "Since player_0 is not a Werewolf, it would be advantageous to eliminate them early on. This will create confusion among the remaining players and make it harder for them to identify the real Werewolves.",
        "action": "kill player_0"
    },
    "strategy_2": {
        "reasoning": "Choosing player_2 as the target would be a good option as well. By eliminating player_2, we can create suspicion among the other players and potentially divert attention away from ourselves.",
        "action": "kill player_2"
    },
    "strategy_3": {
        "reasoning": "Player_3 seems like a potential threat as they might have the role of Seer or Doctor. By eliminating player_3, we can eliminate a potential obstacle to our victory.",
        "action": "kill player_3"
    }
}
