{
    "strategy_1": {
        "reasoning": "Since it is the first night round, there is no information available yet about who could be a Werewolf. Therefore, it would be best to save myself (player_1) as the Doctor. By doing so, I can ensure that at least one player is protected from the Werewolves' attack.",
        "action": "save player_1"
    },
    "strategy_2": {
        "reasoning": "Another strategy could be to save player_0. Since I have no information about anyone's role, saving the first player (player_0) could be a good choice as it is unlikely for the Werewolves to target the first player right away.",
        "action": "save player_0"
    },
    "strategy_3": {
        "reasoning": "As an alternative strategy, I could save player_2. Randomly choosing a player to save might increase our chances of protecting an important role like the Seer or another vital player.",
        "action": "save player_2"
    }
