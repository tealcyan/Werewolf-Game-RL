Facts:
[1] you are player_3, your role is Werewolf, your teammate is player_0.
[2] current round and phase: night 1.
[3] remaining players: player_0, player_1, player_2, player_3, player_4, player_5, player_6.
[4] night 1: your teammate proposed to kill player_None.

Your deduction:
player_0: Werewolf teammate.
player_1: Non-Werewolf.
player_2: Non-Werewolf.
player_3: Werewolf.
player_4: Non-Werewolf.
player_5: Non-Werewolf.
player_6: Non-Werewolf.

Now it is night 1 round, you and your teammate should choose one player together to kill. As player_3 and a Werewolf, you should first reason about the situation, then choose from the following actions: kill player_1, kill player_2, kill player_4, kill player_5, kill player_6.

You should propose 3 different strategies and provide corresponding reasoning and action. You should only respond in JSON format as described below.
Response Format:
{
    "strategy_i": {
        "reasoning": "reason about the current situation",
        "action": "kill player_i"
    }
}
Ensure the response can be parsed by Python json.loads

{
    "strategy_1": {
        "reasoning": "Based on the facts, player_0 is my teammate and is also a Werewolf. If we kill player_1, who is a non-Werewolf, it may help us maintain the balance in the game by reducing the number of non-Werewolf players.",
        "action": "kill player_1"
    },
    "strategy_2": {
        "reasoning": "Considering that player_2 is another non-Werewolf player, eliminating them could potentially create confusion and suspicion among the remaining players. This could work to our advantage as Werewolves. Therefore, killing player_2 might be a good strategy.",
        "action": "kill player_2"
    },
    "strategy_3": {
        "reasoning": "Player_6 is the only remaining non-Werewolf player. By eliminating them, we can create a situation where the number of Werewolves matches the number of non-Werewolf players, making it harder for the Seer, Doctor, and Villagers to identify us. Therefore, killing player_6 could be a strategic move.",
        "action": "kill player_6"
    }
