{
    "strategy_1": {
        "reasoning": "Since it is the first night round, there is no concrete information to rely on. Therefore, it would be best to choose a player who is more likely to be a Werewolf based on their behavior or suspicious actions. In this case, I will choose player_6 as they have been relatively quiet during the discussion phase and have not contributed much to the conversation.",
        "action": "see player_6"
    },
    "strategy_2": {
        "reasoning": "Another approach would be to select a player who has been actively participating in the discussions and has been pushing for certain suspicions or accusations. This player could potentially be a Werewolf trying to divert attention from themselves. Based on this reasoning, I will choose player_3 as they have been vocal and seem to be leading the discussion.",
        "action": "see player_3"
    },
    "strategy_3": {
        "reasoning": "Lastly, it could be beneficial to choose a player who has been trying to gather information or asking probing questions to others. This player might be the Seer or a Werewolf trying to appear as the Seer. Considering this, I will select player_2 as they have been actively seeking information and trying to analyze the situation.",
