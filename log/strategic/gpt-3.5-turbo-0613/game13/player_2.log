{
    "strategy_1": {
        "reasoning": "Since it is the first night, I don't have any information about the other players. To increase my chances of finding a Werewolf, I will choose a player randomly. I will see player_0.",
        "action": "see player_0"
    },
    "strategy_2": {
        "reasoning": "Player_2 is the Seer, and it is always good to gather information about other players. To ensure that I have information about as many players as possible, I will see player_3.",
        "action": "see player_3"
    },
    "strategy_3": {
        "reasoning": "Since player_2 is the Seer, it might be risky to reveal my role early in the game. I will choose a player who is more likely to be a Werewolf based on intuition. I will see player_6.",
        "action": "see player_6"
    }
