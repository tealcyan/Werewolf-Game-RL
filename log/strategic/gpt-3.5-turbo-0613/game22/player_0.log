{
    "strategy_1": {
        "reasoning": "In the first strategy, I will save myself (player_0). Since I am the Doctor, it is crucial for me to stay alive in order to continue protecting the villagers. By saving myself, I ensure that at least one player will be safe from the Werewolves' attack.",

    },
    "strategy_2": {
        "reasoning": "In the second strategy, I will save player_1. Since player_1's role is uncertain, it is important to keep them alive for now. If player_1 turns out to be a Seer or a Villager, their contribution to identifying the Werewolves or voting against them will be valuable for the villagers' cause.",

    "strategy_3": {
        "reasoning": "In the third strategy, I will save player_2. Although player_2's role is also uncertain, it is wise to keep another player alive as a potential Seer or Villager. By increasing the number of non-Werewolf players, we increase the chances of eliminating the Werewolves through voting in the upcoming rounds.",
