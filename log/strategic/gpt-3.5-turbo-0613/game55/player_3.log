{
    "strategy_1": {
        "reasoning": "Since it is the first night round and no information has been revealed yet, it is difficult to make an informed decision. Therefore, I will save myself, player_3, as a precautionary measure to increase the chances of the Doctor surviving.",
       "action": "save player_3"
    },
    "strategy_2": {
        "reasoning": "Considering the possibility of the Werewolves targeting the Seer to eliminate their ability to gather information, I will save player_2. This way, if player_2 is the Seer, they will survive and potentially identify the Werewolves in the following rounds.",
       "action": "save player_2"
    },
    "strategy_3": {
        "reasoning": "As the Doctor, I have no information about the roles of other players. In this case, it might be wise to save a player who seems less suspicious. Based on the limited information available, I will save player_4 as they have not been mentioned as a potential suspect by anyone so far.",
       "action": "save player_4"
    }
