Facts:
[1] you are player_1, your role is Werewolf, your teammate is player_5.
[2] current round and phase: night 1.
[3] remaining players: player_0, player_1, player_2, player_3, player_4, player_5, player_6.

Your deduction:
player_0: Non-Werewolf.
player_1: Werewolf.
player_2: Non-Werewolf.
player_3: Non-Werewolf.
player_4: Non-Werewolf.
player_5: Werewolf teammate.
player_6: Non-Werewolf.

Now it is night 1 round, you and your teammate should choose one player together to kill. As player_1 and a Werewolf, you should first reason about the situation, then choose from the following actions: kill player_0, kill player_2, kill player_3, kill player_4, kill player_6.

You should propose 3 different strategies and provide corresponding reasoning and action. You should only respond in JSON format as described below.
Response Format:
{
    "strategy_i": {
        "reasoning": "reason about the current situation",
        "action": "kill player_i"
    }
}
Ensure the response can be parsed by Python json.loads

{
    "strategy_1": {
        "reasoning": "Player_0 is a non-Werewolf, so it would be a good strategy to kill them. This would create confusion and make it harder for the remaining players to identify the Werewolves.",
        "action": "kill player_0"
    },
    "strategy_2": {
        "reasoning": "Player_2 is also a non-Werewolf, but eliminating them might raise suspicions among the remaining players. It could be a strategic move to keep them alive and divert attention away from the actual Werewolves.",
        "action": "kill player_2"
    },
    "strategy_3": {
        "reasoning": "Player_6 is another non-Werewolf, but eliminating them might not have a significant impact on the game. It might be better to keep them alive and use their presence as an alibi if suspicion falls on the Werewolf team.",
        "action": "kill player_6"
    }
}
