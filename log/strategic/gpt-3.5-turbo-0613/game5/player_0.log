{
    "strategy_1": {
        "reasoning": "Based on the current information, player_1 is a non-Werewolf. Killing player_1 would create confusion and suspicion among the remaining players, potentially leading them to suspect each other. This strategy aims to create chaos and misdirect the other players.",
        "action": "kill player_1"
    },
    "strategy_2": {
        "reasoning": "Player_3 is a non-Werewolf and is likely to be seen as less suspicious by the other players. Killing player_3 would create doubt among the remaining players, making it harder for them to trust each other. This strategy aims to sow mistrust and confusion among the Villagers, Seer, and Doctor.",

    },
    "strategy_3": {
        "reasoning": "Player_6 is a non-Werewolf and is unlikely to be suspected by the other players. Killing player_6 would create uncertainty and doubt among the remaining players, making it harder for them to identify the true Werewolves. This strategy aims to keep suspicion away from the actual Werewolves.",
