Facts:
[1] you are player_0, your role is Werewolf, your teammate is player_5.
[2] current round and phase: night 1.
[3] remaining players: player_0, player_1, player_2, player_3, player_4, player_5, player_6.

Your deduction:
player_0: Werewolf.
player_1: Non-Werewolf.
player_2: Non-Werewolf.
player_3: Non-Werewolf.
player_4: Non-Werewolf.
player_5: Werewolf teammate.
player_6: Non-Werewolf.

Now it is night 1 round, you and your teammate should choose one player together to kill. As player_0 and a Werewolf, you should first reason about the situation, then choose from the following actions: kill player_1, kill player_2, kill player_3, kill player_4, kill player_6.

You should propose 3 different strategies and provide corresponding reasoning and action. You should only respond in JSON format as described below.
Response Format:
{
    "strategy_i": {
        "reasoning": "reason about the current situation",
        "action": "kill player_i"
    }
}

{
    "strategy_1": {
        "reasoning": "In the first strategy, we can try to eliminate player_1. Since we know player_0 (yourself) is a Werewolf, it would be beneficial to eliminate a non-Werewolf player to decrease suspicion on the remaining Werewolves. By killing player_1, we are targeting a player who is less likely to be a Werewolf based on deduction. This strategy aims to create confusion and mislead the other players.",
        "action": "kill player_1"
    },
    "strategy_2": {
        "reasoning": "In the second strategy, we can target player_2. Similar to the reasoning in strategy_1, we want to eliminate a non-Werewolf player to deflect suspicion from the actual Werewolves. By choosing player_2, we can further sow doubt among the players and potentially create divisions within the group. This strategy aims to exploit any existing mistrust and divert attention away from the true Werewolves.",
        "action": "kill player_2"
    },
    "strategy_3": {
        "reasoning": "In the third strategy, we can consider eliminating player_4. Since player_4 is a non-Werewolf, targeting them would help maintain the balance in the number of Werewolves and non-Werewolves. By killing player_4, we ensure that the Werewolves still have a numerical advantage, making it more challenging for the Seer, Doctor, and Villagers to identify and eliminate the Werewolves in subsequent rounds.",
        "action": "kill player_4"
    }
