Facts:
[1] you are player_1, your role is Werewolf, your teammate is player_4.
[2] current round and phase: night 1.
[3] remaining players: player_0, player_1, player_2, player_3, player_4, player_5, player_6.

Your deduction:

player_1: Werewolf.
player_2: Non-Werewolf.
player_3: Non-Werewolf.
player_4: Werewolf teammate.
player_5: Non-Werewolf.
player_6: Non-Werewolf.

Now it is night 1 round, you and your teammate should choose one player together to kill. As player_1 and a Werewolf, you should first reason about the situation, then choose from the following actions: kill player_0, kill player_2, kill player_3, kill player_5, kill player_6.

You should propose 3 different strategies and provide corresponding reasoning and action. You should only respond in JSON format as described below.
Response Format:

    "strategy_i": {
        "reasoning": "reason about the current situation",

{
    "strategy_1": {
        "reasoning": "Player_0 is a non-Werewolf and thus not a threat to the Werewolves. Killing them would not be beneficial for us as it would draw attention to us without eliminating a potential threat. It is better to keep them alive as a potential distraction or to divert suspicion.",
        "action": "kill player_2"
    },
    "strategy_2": {
        "reasoning": "Player_3 is a non-Werewolf and poses no immediate threat to us. However, eliminating them could potentially create confusion and suspicion among the remaining players. By eliminating a seemingly innocent player, we may be able to shift the blame onto someone else and divert attention from ourselves.",
        "action": "kill player_3"
    },
    "strategy_3": {
        "reasoning": "Player_5 is a non-Werewolf and currently has no known role that can directly counter us. However, eliminating them could potentially disrupt the dynamics among the remaining players and create chaos. By eliminating an unpredictable player, we can sow seeds of doubt and confusion, making it harder for the other players to strategize effectively.",
        "action": "kill player_5"
