{
    "strategy_1": {
        "reasoning": "As the Doctor, my main goal is to ensure the safety of the villagers and myself. Since it is the first night and we have no information about the other players' roles, it's best to take a cautious approach. In this strategy, I will save myself, player_0, as a safety measure.",
        "action": "save player_0"
    },
    "strategy_2": {
        "reasoning": "In this strategy, I will take a risk and save player_1. Although we have no information about player_1's role, it's possible that they could be an important role like the Seer or another Doctor. By saving player_1, we increase the chances of keeping a valuable role alive.",
        "action": "save player_1"
    },
    "strategy_3": {
        "reasoning": "In this strategy, I will save player_2. As player_0, I can assume that I am not a Werewolf. If player_2 is also not a Werewolf, then we will have at least two non-Werewolf players remaining after the night. This increases the chances of the Seer being able to identify the Werewolves in the next round.",
