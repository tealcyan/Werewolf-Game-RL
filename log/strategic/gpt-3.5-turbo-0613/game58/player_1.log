{
    "strategy_1": {
        "reasoning": "Since it is the first night and we have no information about the other players' roles, it would be reasonable to save myself (player_1) as the Doctor. This way, even if the Werewolves target me, I will be protected and have a higher chance of surviving.",
       "action": "save player_1"
    },
    "strategy_2": {
        "reasoning": "As the Doctor, I could also consider saving player_0. Since we have no information about the roles of other players, it is a good idea to protect a random player, and player_0 is the first player in the list. By doing this, we increase the chances of having more players alive to gather information in the next rounds.",
       "action": "save player_0"
    },
    "strategy_3": {
        "reasoning": "Another strategy could be to save player_2. This is assuming that player_2 appears less suspicious or has shown signs of being a valuable role such as the Seer. By protecting player_2, we increase the chances of keeping a potential valuable role alive.",
       "action": "save player_2"
