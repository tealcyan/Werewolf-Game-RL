[2] current round and phase: night 1.

You should propose 3 different strategies and provide corresponding reasoning and action. You should only respond in JSON format as described below.

        "reasoning": "In strategy 1, I will propose killing player_1. Since player_1 is the first player after me and they have not yet had a chance to speak in the discussion phase, it would be strategic to eliminate them as they might have valuable information or suspicions about the Werewolves. Killing player_1 will potentially disrupt the Villagers' ability to deduce our identities.",

    "strategy_2": {
        "reasoning": "In strategy 2, I will propose killing player_3. Although player_3 is not directly adjacent to me, they are the third player to speak in the discussion phase and might have gathered information from player_1 and player_2. By eliminating player_3, we can disrupt the flow of information among the Villagers and make it more challenging for them to identify the Werewolves.",

    "strategy_3": {
        "reasoning": "In strategy 3, I will propose killing player_5. As the fifth player to speak in the discussion phase, player_5 might have gathered valuable information or suspicions about the Werewolves from player_3 and player_4. By eliminating player_5, we can further disrupt the Villagers' ability to piece together the puzzle and make it harder for them to pinpoint the Werewolves.",
