Facts:
[1] you are player_1, your role is Seer.
[2] current round and phase: night 1.

Your deduction:
player_0: Uncertain.

player_4: Uncertain.
player_5: Uncertain.

Now it is night 1 round, you should choose one player to see if they are a Werewolf. As player_1 and a Seer, you should first reason about the situation, then choose from the following actions: see player_0, see player_2, see player_3, see player_4, see player_5, see player_6.

You should propose 3 different strategies and provide corresponding reasoning and action. You should only respond in JSON format as described below.
Response Format:
{
    "strategy_i": {
        "reasoning": "reason about the current situation",
        "action": "see player_i"
    }
}
Ensure the response can be parsed by Python json.loads

{
    "strategy_1": {
        "reasoning": "Since it is the first night, I don't have any information about the other players' roles. It would be a good idea to choose a player randomly to see if they are a Werewolf. This will give us some initial information to start with.",
        "action": "see player_0"
    },
    "strategy_2": {
        "reasoning": "Based on my intuition, I have a feeling that player_4 might be a Werewolf. They have been acting suspiciously during the game, and it would be worth investigating their role.",
        "action": "see player_4"
    },
    "strategy_3": {
        "reasoning": "player_2 has been very quiet during the discussion phase, which could indicate that they are trying to stay under the radar as a Werewolf. I think it would be wise to see if they are indeed a Werewolf.",
        "action": "see player_2"
    }
