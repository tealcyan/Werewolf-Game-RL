    },
    "strategy_2": {
        "reasoning": "Considering player_0 as the Doctor, I will save player_0. As the Doctor, it is crucial for me to protect myself during the early stages of the game. By doing so, I can ensure that there is at least one confirmed Villager alive in the next day round.",
