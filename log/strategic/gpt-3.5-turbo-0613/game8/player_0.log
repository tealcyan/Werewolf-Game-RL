Facts:
[1] you are player_0, your role is Werewolf, your teammate is player_2.
[2] current round and phase: night 1.
[3] remaining players: player_0, player_1, player_2, player_3, player_4, player_5, player_6.

Your deduction:
player_0: Werewolf.
player_1: Non-Werewolf.
player_2: Werewolf teammate.
player_3: Non-Werewolf.
player_4: Non-Werewolf.
player_5: Non-Werewolf.
player_6: Non-Werewolf.

Now it is night 1 round, you and your teammate should choose one player together to kill. As player_0 and a Werewolf, you should first reason about the situation, then choose from the following actions: kill player_1, kill player_3, kill player_4, kill player_5, kill player_6.

You should propose 3 different strategies and provide corresponding reasoning and action. You should only respond in JSON format as described below.
Response Format:
{
    "strategy_i": {
        "reasoning": "reason about the current situation",
        "action": "kill player_i"
    }
}
Ensure the response can be parsed by Python json.loads

{
    "strategy_1": {
        "reasoning": "I propose killing player_1. As a Werewolf, it is in our best interest to eliminate a non-Werewolf player. By targeting player_1, we can potentially create confusion and suspicion among the remaining players, making it harder for them to identify us as the Werewolves.",
        "action": "kill player_1"
    },
    "strategy_2": {
        "reasoning": "I propose killing player_3. Based on the deduction, player_3 is highly likely to be a non-Werewolf. By eliminating player_3, we can reduce the number of potential non-Werewolf players and increase the chances of the remaining players suspecting each other instead of us.",
        "action": "kill player_3"
    },
    "strategy_3": {
        "reasoning": "I propose killing player_6. Although we have no specific reason to suspect player_6, choosing a random player can sometimes be a good strategy in the early stages of the game. It can create confusion among the remaining players and make it harder for them to form a strong alliance against us.",
        "action": "kill player_6"
