[7] in day 1 discussion, player_2 said: I think it is important for us to openly share our thoughts and suspicions. Let's start by discussing player_0's suggestion. They proposed investigating player_2 tonight as they haven't been suspected yet. While it is true that player_2 could be a Werewolf, we shouldn't solely focus on them without any evidence. We need the Seer's input to make an informed decision. So, I suggest we wait for the Seer's investigation results before accusing anyone.

Facts:
[1] you are player_5, your role is Seer.
[2] current round and phase: day 2 voting.
[3] remaining players: player_3, player_4, player_5, player_6.
[4] night 1: you saw player_0 is a Werewolf.
[5] day 1 announcement: player_1 was killed last night.
[6] in day 1 discussion, your said: I have information that player_0 is a Werewolf. We should discuss and analyze the actions and behavior of player_0 during the previous night and the current day. Other players, please share your observations and thoughts regarding player_0. Let's work together to gather more evidence and make an informed decision during the voting phase.
[7] day 1 voting: player_0 had the most votes and was eliminated. player_3, player_5 voted for player_0. player_4 voted for player_5. player_0, player_2, player_6 chose not to vote.
[8] night 2: you saw player_2 is not a Werewolf.
[9] day 2 announcement: player_2 was killed last night.
[10] in day 2 discussion, your said: Based on my Seer ability, I can confirm that player_2 is not a Werewolf. This means that player_3, player_4, and player_6 are the only remaining players who could potentially be the Werewolves. I find it suspicious that both player_3 and player_4 voted for player_0 yesterday, who turned out to be a Villager. This suggests that one of them might be a Werewolf trying to divert suspicion away from themselves. I suggest that we focus our discussion on these two players and analyze their actions and behavior during the previous night and the current day. Let's gather more evidence and share our observations to make an informed decision during the voting phase.

Potential deceptions:
[11] in day 2 discussion, player_6 said: I would like to point out that player_3's voting pattern and their association with the previous day's elimination of player_0. It is suspicious that they voted for a Villager and potentially tried to frame player_4. I think we should analyze player_3's behavior and actions during the previous night and the current day to gather more evidence. Let's also encourage player_4 to share their observations and thoughts about player_3. This will help us make an informed decision during the voting phase.

Your deduction:
player_3: Uncertain.
player_4: Uncertain.
player_5: Seer.
player_6: Uncertain.

Now it is day 2 voting phase. As player_5 and a Seer, you should choose from the following strategies:
strategy_1: {
    "reasoning": "Based on the information I gathered as a Seer, I know that player_2 is not a Werewolf. This means that player_3, player_4, and player_6 are the remaining players who could potentially be the Werewolves. However, player_3 and player_4 have raised suspicion due to their voting pattern and association with the previous day's elimination of player_0. Considering this, I will vote for player_3 as they were the first to vote for player_0 and their actions seem suspicious.",
    "action": "vote for player_3"
}
strategy_2: {
    "reasoning": "Although player_3 has raised suspicion due to their voting pattern, it is also important to consider player_4's behavior and actions. They voted for player_5 yesterday, who turned out to be the Seer. This could indicate that player_4 is trying to divert suspicion away from themselves. Taking this into account, I will vote for player_4 as they seem more likely to be a Werewolf.",
    "action": "vote for player_4"

{
    "reasoning": "Based on the information available, strategy_1 seems to be the best choice. While there is uncertainty surrounding both player_3 and player_4, player_3's suspicious voting pattern and association with the previous day's elimination of player_0 make them a more likely candidate to be a Werewolf. By voting for player_3, there is a higher chance of eliminating a Werewolf and moving closer to victory for the Seer, Doctor, and Villagers.",
