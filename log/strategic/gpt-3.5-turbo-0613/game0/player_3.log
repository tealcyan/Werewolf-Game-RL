[1] you are player_3, your role is Villager.

[3] remaining players: player_0, player_2, player_3, player_4, player_5, player_6.
[4] day 1 announcement: player_1 was killed last night.

Potential deceptions:
[5] in day 1 discussion, player_0 said: I think we should focus our investigation on player_2 tonight. They haven't been suspected yet, and it's worth considering that they might be a Werewolf. Let's see what the Seer finds out.
[6] in day 1 discussion, player_2 said: I think it is important for us to openly share our thoughts and suspicions. Let's start by discussing player_0's suggestion. They proposed investigating player_2 tonight as they haven't been suspected yet. While it is true that player_2 could be a Werewolf, we shouldn't solely focus on them without any evidence. We need the Seer's input to make an informed decision. So, I suggest we wait for the Seer's investigation results before accusing anyone.

Your previous deduction:
player_0: Uncertain.
player_2: Uncertain.
player_3: Villager.
player_4: Uncertain.
player_5: Uncertain.
player_6: Uncertain.

As player_3 and a Villager, you should reflect on your previous deduction and reconsider the hidden roles of player_0, player_2, player_4, player_5, player_6. Remember there is at least one Werewolf among them. You should provide your reasoning, rate your confidence, and cite all key information as evidence to support your deduction.
