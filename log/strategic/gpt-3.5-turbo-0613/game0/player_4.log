[6] day 1 announcement: player_1 was killed last night.
[7] in day 1 discussion, your said: I think we should focus our investigation on player_2 tonight. They haven't been suspected yet, and it's worth considering that they might be a Werewolf. Let's see what the Seer finds out.
[8] day 1 voting: player_0 had the most votes and was eliminated. player_3, player_5 voted for player_0. player_4 voted for player_5. player_0, player_2, player_6 chose not to vote.
[9] night 2: you chose to kill player_2.
[10] day 2 announcement: player_2 was killed last night.
[11] in day 2 discussion, your said: I suggest we pay close attention to player_5's previous suspicion towards player_0. They voted for player_0 in the previous round, but we need to question the basis of their suspicion. Player_5, could you provide more details about your suspicion towards player_0? What actions or behaviors of player_0 make you believe they are a Werewolf? If we can carefully analyze player_5's reasoning, we might uncover inconsistencies or ulterior motives behind their vote.

Potential truths:
[12] in day 2 discussion, player_3 said: Player_5, could you provide more details about your suspicion towards player_0? What actions or behaviors of player_0 make you believe they are a Werewolf? Player_6, do you have any insights or observations regarding the previous night's events or the remaining players? It is crucial that we gather as much information as possible to make an informed decision during the voting phase.
[13] in day 2 discussion, player_5 said: Based on my Seer ability, I can confirm that player_2 is not a Werewolf. This means that player_3, player_4, and player_6 are the only remaining players who could potentially be the Werewolves. I find it suspicious that both player_3 and player_4 voted for player_0 yesterday, who turned out to be a Villager. This suggests that one of them might be a Werewolf trying to divert suspicion away from themselves. I suggest that we focus our discussion on these two players and analyze their actions and behavior during the previous night and the current day. Let's gather more evidence and share our observations to make an informed decision during the voting phase.
[14] in day 2 discussion, player_6 said: I would like to point out that player_3's voting pattern and their association with the previous day's elimination of player_0. It is suspicious that they voted for a Villager and potentially tried to frame player_4. I think we should analyze player_3's behavior and actions during the previous night and the current day to gather more evidence. Let's also encourage player_4 to share their observations and thoughts about player_3. This will help us make an informed decision during the voting phase.

Your deduction:
player_3: likely to be a Seer.
player_4: Werewolf.
player_5: may be a Villager.
