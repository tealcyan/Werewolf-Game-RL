2024-05-13 00:33:46,395 INFO player_2 (Villager) said: "I think it is important for us to openly share our thoughts and suspicions. Let's start by discussing player_0's suggestion. They proposed investigating player_2 tonight as they haven't been suspected yet. While it is true that player_2 could be a Werewolf, we shouldn't solely focus on them without any evidence. We need the Seer's input to make an informed decision. So, I suggest we wait for the Seer's investigation results before accusing anyone."
2024-05-13 00:33:56,846 INFO player_3 (Villager) said: "I think it would be helpful if each player shares their thoughts and suspicions about the remaining players. Let's start with player_0. Do you have any suspicions or information that you would like to share?"

We should discuss and analyze the actions and behavior of player_0 during the previous night and the current day. Other players, please share your observations and thoughts regarding player_0. Let's work together to gather more evidence and make an informed decision during the voting phase."
2024-05-13 00:34:34,626 INFO player_6 (Doctor) said: "I agree with player_2 and player_7 that we should wait for the Seer's investigation results before accusing anyone. It is important to have concrete evidence instead of relying on suspicions alone. Let's encourage everyone to share their observations and thoughts about the remaining players, so we can gather more information and make an informed decision during the voting phase."

What actions or behaviors of player_0 make you believe they are a Werewolf? Player_6, do you have any insights or observations regarding the previous night's events or the remaining players? It is crucial that we gather as much information as possible to make an informed decision during the voting phase."
2024-05-13 00:36:36,274 INFO player_4 (Werewolf) said: "I suggest we pay close attention to player_5's previous suspicion towards player_0. They voted for player_0 in the previous round, but we need to question the basis of their suspicion. Player_5, could you provide more details about your suspicion towards player_0? What actions or behaviors of player_0 make you believe they are a Werewolf? If we can carefully analyze player_5's reasoning, we might uncover inconsistencies or ulterior motives behind their vote."
2024-05-13 00:36:49,797 INFO player_5 (Seer) said: "Based on my Seer ability, I can confirm that player_2 is not a Werewolf. This means that player_3, player_4, and player_6 are the only remaining players who could potentially be the Werewolves. I find it suspicious that both player_3 and player_4 voted for player_0 yesterday, who turned out to be a Villager. This suggests that one of them might be a Werewolf trying to divert suspicion away from themselves. I suggest that we focus our discussion on these two players and analyze their actions and behavior during the previous night and the current day. Let's gather more evidence and share our observations to make an informed decision during the voting phase."
2024-05-13 00:37:04,441 INFO player_6 (Doctor) said: "I would like to point out that player_3's voting pattern and their association with the previous day's elimination of player_0. It is suspicious that they voted for a Villager and potentially tried to frame player_4. I think we should analyze player_3's behavior and actions during the previous night and the current day to gather more evidence. Let's also encourage player_4 to share their observations and thoughts about player_3. This will help us make an informed decision during the voting phase."
