Facts:
[1] you are player_0, your role is Werewolf, your teammate is player_3.
[2] current round and phase: night 1.
[3] remaining players: player_0, player_1, player_2, player_3, player_4, player_5, player_6.

Your deduction:
player_0: Werewolf.
player_1: Non-Werewolf.
player_2: Non-Werewolf.
player_3: Werewolf teammate.
player_4: Non-Werewolf.
player_5: Non-Werewolf.
player_6: Non-Werewolf.

Now it is night 1 round, you and your teammate should choose one player together to kill. As player_0 and a Werewolf, you should first reason about the situation, then choose from the following actions: kill player_1, kill player_2, kill player_4, kill player_5, kill player_6.

You should propose 3 different strategies and provide corresponding reasoning and action. You should only respond in JSON format as described below.
Response Format:
{
    "strategy_i": {
        "reasoning": "reason about the current situation",
        "action": "kill player_i"
    }
}
Ensure the response can be parsed by Python json.loads

{
    "strategy_1": {
        "reasoning": "Since player_0 and player_3 are both Werewolves, it would be suspicious to kill player_1 or player_2, as it might make the other players suspect that the Werewolves are targeting the non-Werewolves first. Therefore, it would be a good strategy to kill player_4, as it would create confusion and cast doubt on player_0 and player_3.",
        "action": "kill player_4"
    },
    "strategy_2": {
        "reasoning": "Another strategy could be to kill player_5. This is because player_5 is a non-Werewolf and eliminating a non-Werewolf in the first night might lead the other players to suspect that player_0 and player_3 are trying to eliminate non-Werewolves first. This strategy might help in creating confusion and misdirection.",
        "action": "kill player_5"
    },
    "strategy_3": {
        "reasoning": "A third strategy could be to kill player_6. Since player_6 is also a non-Werewolf, eliminating them would create doubt among the other players, as it might seem like player_0 and player_3 are targeting non-Werewolves first. This strategy aims to sow confusion and mislead the other players.",
