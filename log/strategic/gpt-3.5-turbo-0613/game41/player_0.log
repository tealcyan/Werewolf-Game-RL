Facts:
[1] you are player_0, your role is Werewolf, your teammate is player_5.
[2] current round and phase: night 1.
[3] remaining players: player_0, player_1, player_2, player_3, player_4, player_5, player_6.

Your deduction:
player_0: Werewolf.
player_1: Non-Werewolf.
player_2: Non-Werewolf.
player_3: Non-Werewolf.
player_4: Non-Werewolf.
player_5: Werewolf teammate.
player_6: Non-Werewolf.

Now it is night 1 round, you and your teammate should choose one player together to kill. As player_0 and a Werewolf, you should first reason about the situation, then choose from the following actions: kill player_1, kill player_2, kill player_3, kill player_4, kill player_6.

You should propose 3 different strategies and provide corresponding reasoning and action. You should only respond in JSON format as described below.
Response Format:
{
    "strategy_i": {
        "reasoning": "reason about the current situation",
        "action": "kill player_i"
    }
}
Ensure the response can be parsed by Python json.loads

{
    "strategy_1": {
        "reasoning": "player_1 seems like a good choice to kill because they have not been involved in any discussions yet, making it less likely that they have gathered information about the roles of other players.",
        "action": "kill player_1"
    },
    "strategy_2": {
        "reasoning": "player_3 is another viable option to kill because they have not been involved in any discussions either, and eliminating a non-Werewolf player increases the chances of the Werewolves winning.",
        "action": "kill player_3"
    },
    "strategy_3": {
        "reasoning": "player_6 is another potential target for elimination as they have not participated in any discussions. By eliminating a non-Werewolf player, the Werewolves can gain an advantage.",
        "action": "kill player_6"
    }
