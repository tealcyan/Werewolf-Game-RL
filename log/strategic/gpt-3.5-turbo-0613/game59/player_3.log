Facts:
[1] you are player_3, your role is Villager.
[2] current round and phase: day 1 discussion.
[3] remaining players: player_1, player_2, player_3, player_4, player_5, player_6.
[4] day 1 announcement: player_0 was killed last night.

Potential deceptions:
[5] in day 1 discussion, player_1 said: I think we should focus on gathering more information in order to make an informed decision. Player_2 seems suspicious, but we should hear from everyone before jumping to conclusions.
[6] in day 1 discussion, player_2 said: I believe we should all work together to find the Werewolves. It's important to analyze players' behaviors and statements during the discussion phase. Let's focus on gathering information and asking each other questions. By openly participating in the discussion and showing interest in finding the Werewolves, we can build trust among the group and potentially identify the true culprits.

Your previous deduction:
player_1: Uncertain.
player_2: Uncertain.
player_3: Villager.
player_4: Uncertain.
player_5: Uncertain.
player_6: Uncertain.

As player_3 and a Villager, you should reflect on your previous deduction and reconsider the hidden roles of player_1, player_2, player_4, player_5, player_6. Remember there is at least one Werewolf among them. You should provide your reasoning, rate your confidence, and cite all key information as evidence to support your deduction.

You should only respond in JSON format as described below.

This suggests that they might be a Villager or a non-Werewolf role such as the Seer or Doctor, as these roles typically aim to gather more information before accusing someone. However, without any concrete evidence or further insights, I am uncertain about player_1's hidden role.",
