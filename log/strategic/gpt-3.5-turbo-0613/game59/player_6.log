{
    "reasoning": "The best strategy is to kill player_0. Since player_2 is my teammate and we are both Werewolves, it is best to eliminate a non-Werewolf player. By killing player_0, we can create suspicion among the remaining players and potentially lead them astray in their investigations and discussions.",
