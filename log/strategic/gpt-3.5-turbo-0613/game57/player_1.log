Facts:
[1] you are player_1, your role is Werewolf, your teammate is player_4.
[2] current round and phase: night 1.
[3] remaining players: player_0, player_1, player_2, player_3, player_4, player_5, player_6.

Your deduction:
player_0: Non-Werewolf.
player_1: Werewolf.
player_2: Non-Werewolf.
player_3: Non-Werewolf.
player_4: Werewolf teammate.
player_5: Non-Werewolf.
player_6: Non-Werewolf.

Now it is night 1 round, you and your teammate should choose one player together to kill. As player_1 and a Werewolf, you should first reason about the situation, then choose from the following actions: kill player_0, kill player_2, kill player_3, kill player_5, kill player_6.

You should propose 3 different strategies and provide corresponding reasoning and action. You should only respond in JSON format as described below.
Response Format:
{
    "strategy_i": {
        "reasoning": "reason about the current situation",

{
    "strategy_1": {
        "reasoning": "Based on the deduction, player_0, player_2, player_3, player_5, and player_6 are all non-Werewolves. Therefore, it would be strategic to kill player_0 as they are not on our team and eliminating potential suspects can help us blend in better.",
        "action": "kill player_0"
    },
    "strategy_2": {
        "reasoning": "Another strategy could be to kill player_2. By eliminating player_2, we create confusion and suspicion among the remaining players. This might divert attention away from us and increase the chances of the Werewolves winning.",
        "action": "kill player_2"
    },
    "strategy_3": {
        "reasoning": "Alternatively, killing player_6 could be a good move. Player_6 has been identified as a non-Werewolf through deduction, but eliminating them would create further doubt and chaos among the remaining players, potentially leading to a more favorable situation for the Werewolves.",
        "action": "kill player_6"
    }
