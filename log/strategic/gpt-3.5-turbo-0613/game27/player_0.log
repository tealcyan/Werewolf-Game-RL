Facts:
[1] you are player_0, your role is Seer.
[2] current round and phase: night 1.

Your deduction:
player_0: Seer.

player_4: Uncertain.
player_5: Uncertain.

Now it is night 1 round, you should choose one player to see if they are a Werewolf. As player_0 and a Seer, you should first reason about the situation, then choose from the following actions: see player_1, see player_2, see player_3, see player_4, see player_5, see player_6.

You should propose 3 different strategies and provide corresponding reasoning and action. You should only respond in JSON format as described below.
Response Format:
{
    "strategy_i": {
        "reasoning": "reason about the current situation",
        "action": "see player_i"
    }
}

{
    "strategy_1": {
        "reasoning": "Since it is the first night, I have no information about anyone's role. In this case, it would be wise to choose a player randomly to see if they are a Werewolf. This will give us some information to start the game.",
        "action": "see player_1"
    },
    "strategy_2": {
        "reasoning": "Based on intuition, player_2 seems suspicious to me. They have been quiet during the discussion phase and this might indicate that they are trying to hide something. To confirm my suspicion, I should see player_2's role.",
        "action": "see player_2"
    },
    "strategy_3": {
        "reasoning": "Player_3 has been actively participating in the discussion and seems genuinely interested in finding the Werewolves. However, this could also be a strategy to divert attention from themselves. To be sure, I should see player_3's role.",
        "action": "see player_3"
    }
