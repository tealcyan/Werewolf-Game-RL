Facts:
[1] you are player_1, your role is Seer.
[2] current round and phase: night 1.

Now it is night 1 round, you should choose one player to see if they are a Werewolf. As player_1 and a Seer, you should first reason about the situation, then choose from the following actions: see player_0, see player_2, see player_3, see player_4, see player_5, see player_6.

You should propose 3 different strategies and provide corresponding reasoning and action. You should only respond in JSON format as described below.
Response Format:
{
    "strategy_i": {
        "reasoning": "reason about the current situation",
        "action": "see player_i"
    }
}
Ensure the response can be parsed by Python json.loads

{
    "strategy_1": {
        "reasoning": "Based on the fact that I am the Seer, I should prioritize choosing a player who is more likely to be a Werewolf. In this case, player_0 seems like a good choice because they are the first player and haven't been mentioned as uncertain by anyone yet.",
        "action": "see player_0"
    },
    "strategy_2": {
        "reasoning": "Another strategy could be to choose a player who has been mentioned as uncertain by others. In this case, player_2 has been described as uncertain by the deduction so far.",
        "action": "see player_2"
    },
    "strategy_3": {
        "reasoning": "Lastly, I could choose a player randomly to keep everyone on their toes. In this case, I will randomly choose player_3.",
