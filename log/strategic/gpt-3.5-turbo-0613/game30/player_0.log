You should propose 3 different strategies and provide corresponding reasoning and action. You should only respond in JSON format as described below.
Response Format:

{
    "strategy_1": {
        "reasoning": "Since it is the first night round and no information is available, it is best to choose a player randomly to see if they are a Werewolf. This way, I can start gathering information and potentially narrow down the list of suspects. I will choose to see player_1.",
        "action": "see player_1"
    },
    "strategy_2": {
        "reasoning": "Considering the number of remaining players and the need to gather information as quickly as possible, I should choose a player who seems suspicious based on their behavior or actions during the discussion phase. This can help eliminate potential Werewolves early on. I will choose to see player_3.",
        "action": "see player_3"
    },
    "strategy_3": {
        "reasoning": "To ensure a balanced approach, I should choose a player who seems less suspicious but still has a chance of being a Werewolf. By doing so, I can gather information and potentially avoid suspicion from other players. I will choose to see player_5.",
        "action": "see player_5"
    }
