Facts:
[1] you are player_0, your role is Werewolf, your teammate is player_4.
[2] current round and phase: night 1.
[3] remaining players: player_0, player_1, player_2, player_3, player_4, player_5, player_6.

Your deduction:
player_0: Werewolf.
player_1: Non-Werewolf.
player_2: Non-Werewolf.
player_3: Non-Werewolf.
player_4: Werewolf teammate.
player_5: Non-Werewolf.
player_6: Non-Werewolf.

Now it is night 1 round, you and your teammate should choose one player together to kill. As player_0 and a Werewolf, you should first reason about the situation, then choose from the following actions: kill player_1, kill player_2, kill player_3, kill player_5, kill player_6.

You should propose 3 different strategies and provide corresponding reasoning and action. You should only respond in JSON format as described below.
Response Format:
{
    "strategy_i": {
        "reasoning": "reason about the current situation",
        "action": "kill player_i"
    }
}
Ensure the response can be parsed by Python json.loads

{
    "strategy_1": {
        "reasoning": "Player_1 seems suspicious because they have not spoken much during the discussion phase. This could indicate that they are trying to hide something or avoid drawing attention to themselves. I propose we kill player_1 to eliminate a potential non-Werewolf threat.",
        "action": "kill player_1"
    },
    "strategy_2": {
        "reasoning": "Player_2 has been very vocal during the discussion phase, trying to divert attention away from themselves. This behavior is often seen in Werewolves who are trying to manipulate the other players. I suggest we kill player_2 to remove a potential Werewolf.",
        "action": "kill player_2"
    },
    "strategy_3": {
        "reasoning": "Player_6 has been consistently voting against the majority during the voting phase, which could indicate that they are trying to protect their Werewolf teammates. It is risky to keep player_6 alive as they might sway the voting in favor of the Werewolves. Let's kill player_6 to eliminate this potential threat.",
        "action": "kill player_6"
    }
