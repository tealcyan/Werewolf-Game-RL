        "reasoning": "In this strategy, I will propose killing player_1. Since player_1 is a non-Werewolf, eliminating them will create confusion and suspicion among the villagers. They may suspect each other and divert their attention away from the real Werewolves.",

    },

        "reasoning": "In this strategy, I will propose killing player_4. While player_4 is also a non-Werewolf, eliminating them will create confusion and suspicion among the villagers, similar to strategy 1. Additionally, player_4 may have a strong influence on the villagers and their elimination might disrupt their plans.",

        "reasoning": "In this strategy, I will propose killing player_6.
