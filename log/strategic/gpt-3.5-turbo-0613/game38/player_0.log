[1] you are player_0, your role is Werewolf, your teammate is player_6.
[2] current round and phase: night 1.
[3] remaining players: player_0, player_1, player_2, player_3, player_4, player_5, player_6.

player_1: Non-Werewolf.
player_2: Non-Werewolf.
player_3: Non-Werewolf.
player_4: Non-Werewolf.

Now it is night 1 round, you and your teammate should choose one player together to kill. As player_0 and a Werewolf, you should first reason about the situation, then choose from the following actions: kill player_1, kill player_2, kill player_3, kill player_4, kill player_5.

You should propose 3 different strategies and provide corresponding reasoning and action. You should only respond in JSON format as described below.

{
    "strategy_1": {
        "reasoning": "I will propose to kill player_1. Since player_1 is a non-Werewolf, eliminating them in the first night will cast suspicion on other players. This can create confusion and make it harder for the Seer and Doctor to identify the Werewolves in the later rounds.",
        "action": "kill player_1"
    },
    "strategy_2": {
        "reasoning": "I will propose to kill player_2. Although player_2 is also a non-Werewolf, eliminating them will create doubt among the remaining players. They might suspect that player_2 was killed because they were getting close to discovering the true identity of the Werewolves.",
        "action": "kill player_2"
    },
    "strategy_3": {
        "reasoning": "I will propose to kill player_3. By targeting player_3, who is a non-Werewolf, it will draw attention away from me and my teammate. This can potentially lead to confusion and mistrust among the remaining players, making it harder for them to identify the actual Werewolves.",
        "action": "kill player_3"
    }
