{
    "strategy_1": {
        "reasoning": "Since it is the first night, I don't have any information about the other players' behaviors or claims. Therefore, I will use a random strategy and choose a player to see.",
        "action": "see player_0"
    },
    "strategy_2": {
        "reasoning": "Player_0 and Player_1 are the closest players to me in the player order. It is more likely for the Werewolves to target players who are closer in order, as it may create confusion among the Villagers. Therefore, I will choose to see Player_1.",
        "action": "see player_1"
    },
    "strategy_3": {
        "reasoning": "Player_6 is the last player in the order, which can sometimes be a favorable position for the Werewolves. They may target the last player, thinking that they will have less time to defend themselves. Therefore, I will choose to see Player_6.",
        "action": "see player_6"
    }
