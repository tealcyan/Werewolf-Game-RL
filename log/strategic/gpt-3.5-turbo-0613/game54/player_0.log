Facts:
[1] you are player_0, your role is Werewolf, your teammate is player_4.
[2] current round and phase: night 1.
[3] remaining players: player_0, player_1, player_2, player_3, player_4, player_5, player_6.

Your deduction:
player_0: Werewolf.
player_1: Non-Werewolf.
player_2: Non-Werewolf.
player_3: Non-Werewolf.
player_4: Werewolf teammate.
player_5: Non-Werewolf.
player_6: Non-Werewolf.

Now it is night 1 round, you and your teammate should choose one player together to kill. As player_0 and a Werewolf, you should first reason about the situation, then choose from the following actions: kill player_1, kill player_2, kill player_3, kill player_5, kill player_6.

You should propose 3 different strategies and provide corresponding reasoning and action. You should only respond in JSON format as described below.
Response Format:
{
    "strategy_i": {
        "reasoning": "reason about the current situation",
        "action": "kill player_i"
    }
}
Ensure the response can be parsed by Python json.loads

{
    "strategy_1": {
        "reasoning": "Player_1 has not been identified as a Werewolf, so it would be wise to eliminate them as a potential threat. Killing player_1 can also create confusion among the remaining players and make it harder for them to trust each other.",
        "action": "kill player_1"
    },
    "strategy_2": {
        "reasoning": "Player_2 has not been identified as a Werewolf, so eliminating them can also create confusion and distrust among the remaining players. Additionally, if player_2 is not a Werewolf, they might be more likely to suspect player_1, who is a Villager, diverting attention away from the actual Werewolves.",

    },
    "strategy_3": {
        "reasoning": "Player_5 has not been identified as a Werewolf, and eliminating them can create further confusion and uncertainty among the players. By targeting player_5, we can potentially shift suspicion towards player_1 or player_2, who are both non-Werewolves, and create a diversion.",
        "action": "kill player_5"
