{
    "strategy_1": {
        "reasoning": "Based on the fact that I am the Seer and it is night 1, I have no information about any player's role. Therefore, I can randomly choose a player to see if they are a Werewolf.",
        "action": "see player_0"
    },
    "strategy_2": {
        "reasoning": "Since I have no information about any player's role, I can try to see if player_1 is a Werewolf. If they are a Werewolf, it would be beneficial for the Village to eliminate them early on.",
        "action": "see player_1"
    },
    "strategy_3": {
        "reasoning": "Considering the fact that I am the Seer and it is night 1, I can take a cautious approach and choose to see player_3. This way, if player_0 or player_1 turn out to be the Doctor or a Villager, I might have a higher chance of finding a Werewolf.",
        "action": "see player_3"
