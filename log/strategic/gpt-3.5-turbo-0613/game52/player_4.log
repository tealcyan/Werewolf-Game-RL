{
    "strategy_1": {
        "reasoning": "Based on the facts, player_0, player_1, player_2, player_3, and player_6 are all non-Werewolves. Therefore, it would be beneficial for us to eliminate a player who might have a higher chance of being a Seer, Doctor, or Villager. In this case, we should kill player_6.",
        "action": "kill player_6"
    },
    "strategy_2": {
        "reasoning": "Considering that player_0 and player_1 have been declared as non-Werewolves, it is possible that they are the Seer or the Doctor. To reduce the risk of our Werewolf identity being revealed, we should eliminate one of them. Let's choose player_0 as our target.",
        "action": "kill player_0"
    },
    "strategy_3": {
        "reasoning": "Since player_4 and player_5 are both Werewolves, it might be advantageous for us to appear less suspicious by targeting a player who has been more vocal during the discussion phase. In this case, player_3 seems to have taken a more active role, so let's eliminate player_3.",
        "action": "kill player_3"
