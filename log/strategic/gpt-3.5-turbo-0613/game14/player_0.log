    "strategy_2": {
        "reasoning": "Based on the order of players, player_1 is the first player after me. If player_1 is a Villager, it would be useful to know their role. Therefore, I will choose player_1 to see if they are a Werewolf.",

    },
    "strategy_3": {
        "reasoning": "Player_2 is the second player after me. If player_1 is a Villager, player_2 would be the next logical choice to see if they are a Werewolf. Therefore, I will choose player_2 to see if they are a Werewolf.",
