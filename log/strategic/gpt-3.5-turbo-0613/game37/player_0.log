Facts:
[1] you are player_0, your role is Seer.
[2] current round and phase: night 1.
[3] remaining players: player_0, player_1, player_2, player_3, player_4, player_5, player_6.

Your deduction:
player_0: Seer.
player_1: Uncertain.
player_2: Uncertain.
player_3: Uncertain.
player_4: Uncertain.
player_5: Uncertain.
player_6: Uncertain.

Now it is night 1 round, you should choose one player to see if they are a Werewolf. As player_0 and a Seer, you should first reason about the situation, then choose from the following actions: see player_1, see player_2, see player_3, see player_4, see player_5, see player_6.

You should propose 3 different strategies and provide corresponding reasoning and action. You should only respond in JSON format as described below.
Response Format:
{
    "strategy_i": {
        "reasoning": "reason about the current situation",
        "action": "see player_i"
    }
}
Ensure the response can be parsed by Python json.loads

{
    "strategy_1": {
        "reasoning": "In the first strategy, I will choose to see player_1. Since it is the first night and I have no information about any player's behavior, I will randomly select player_1 to see if they are a Werewolf. This will help me gather some initial information and potentially narrow down the list of suspects.",
        "action": "see player_1"
    },
    "strategy_2": {
        "reasoning": "In the second strategy, I will choose to see player_4. Although it is still the first night and I have no concrete evidence, I have a gut feeling that player_4 might be a Werewolf. This intuition can be based on their behavior during the initial discussion or any suspicious actions they may have displayed. By seeing player_4, I can either confirm or refute my suspicion.",
        "action": "see player_4"
    },
    "strategy_3": {
        "reasoning": "In the third strategy, I will choose to see player_6. My reasoning for this choice is that player_6 has been relatively quiet during the initial discussion phase, which could be a tactic used by the Werewolves to avoid suspicion. By seeing player_6, I can potentially uncover their true role and gather valuable information for future rounds.",
        "action": "see player_6"
    }
