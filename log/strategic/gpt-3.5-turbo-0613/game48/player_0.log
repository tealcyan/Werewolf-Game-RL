Facts:
[1] you are player_0, your role is Seer.
[2] current round and phase: night 1.

Your deduction:
player_0: Seer.

player_4: Uncertain.
player_5: Uncertain.
player_6: Uncertain.

Now it is night 1 round, you should choose one player to see if they are a Werewolf. As player_0 and a Seer, you should first reason about the situation, then choose from the following actions: see player_1, see player_2, see player_3, see player_4, see player_5, see player_6.

You should propose 3 different strategies and provide corresponding reasoning and action. You should only respond in JSON format as described below.
Response Format:
{
    "strategy_i": {
        "reasoning": "reason about the current situation",
        "action": "see player_i"
    }
}

{
    "strategy_1": {
        "reasoning": "I will see player_1. There is an equal chance of player_1 being a Werewolf or a Villager. If player_1 turns out to be a Werewolf, it will be beneficial for the Villagers to know this information early in the game.",
        "action": "see player_1"
    },
    "strategy_2": {
        "reasoning": "I will see player_2. Since player_0 is the Seer, it is important to gather information about players who are not adjacent to player_0. By seeing player_2, I can potentially gain valuable information about their role and narrow down the possibilities.",
        "action": "see player_2"
    },
    "strategy_3": {
        "reasoning": "I will see player_3. It is always a good strategy to start by investigating players who have been actively participating in the discussion phase. By seeing player_3, I can potentially find out their role and analyze their contributions to the game so far.",
        "action": "see player_3"
    }
