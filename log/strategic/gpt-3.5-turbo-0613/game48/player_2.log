Facts:
[1] you are player_2, your role is Werewolf, your teammate is player_6.
[2] current round and phase: night 1.
[3] remaining players: player_0, player_1, player_2, player_3, player_4, player_5, player_6.

Your deduction:
player_0: Non-Werewolf.
player_1: Non-Werewolf.
player_2: Werewolf.
player_3: Non-Werewolf.
player_4: Non-Werewolf.
player_5: Non-Werewolf.
player_6: Werewolf teammate.

Now it is night 1 round, you and your teammate should choose one player together to kill. As player_2 and a Werewolf, you should first reason about the situation, then choose from the following actions: kill player_0, kill player_1, kill player_3, kill player_4, kill player_5.

You should propose 3 different strategies and provide corresponding reasoning and action. You should only respond in JSON format as described below.
Response Format:
{
    "strategy_i": {
        "reasoning": "reason about the current situation",
        "action": "kill player_i"
    }
}
Ensure the response can be parsed by Python json.loads

{
    "strategy_1": {
        "reasoning": "Since player_0 is a Villager, eliminating them will reduce the number of potential threats to the Werewolves. Killing player_0 is a strategic move to maintain the advantage for the Werewolves.",
        "action": "kill player_0"
    },
    "strategy_2": {
        "reasoning": "If player_1 is the Seer, they may have had a chance to identify one of the Werewolves. Eliminating player_1 can prevent them from revealing the Werewolves' identities to the other players.",
        "action": "kill player_1"
    },
    "strategy_3": {
        "reasoning": "Player_3 is not suspected to be a Werewolf based on the deduction so far. Killing player_3 can create confusion and uncertainty among the other players, making it harder for them to identify the actual Werewolves.",
        "action": "kill player_3"
    }
}
