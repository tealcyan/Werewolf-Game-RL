{
    "strategy_1": {
        "reasoning": "One possible strategy is to target player_0. Since player_0 is a non-Werewolf, eliminating them will reduce the number of potential suspects for the other players. This can create confusion and make it harder for the Seer and Doctor to identify and protect the real threats.",
        "action": "kill player_0"
    },
    "strategy_2": {
        "reasoning": "Another strategy is to target player_1. Similar to targeting player_0, eliminating player_1 who is also a non-Werewolf can create confusion and suspicion among the remaining players. This can also disrupt any potential alliances or trust that might have formed among the players, making it easier for the Werewolves to deceive and manipulate.",
        "action": "kill player_1"
    },
    "strategy_3": {
        "reasoning": "A third strategy is to target player_4. While player_4 is a non-Werewolf, eliminating them can potentially create a false sense of security among the remaining players. The Seer or Doctor might focus their attention on player_4, thinking they are one of the Werewolves, allowing the real Werewolves to continue their actions undetected.",
        "action": "kill player_4"
