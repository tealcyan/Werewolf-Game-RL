[2] current round and phase: night 1.

You should propose 3 different strategies and provide corresponding reasoning and action. You should only respond in JSON format as described below.

        "reasoning": "In this strategy, we choose to kill player_0. Player_0 is a non-Werewolf, so eliminating them will create confusion and suspicion among the remaining players. This can potentially lead to misdirected accusations and divert attention away from us, the actual Werewolves.",

    },
    "strategy_2": {
        "reasoning": "In this strategy, we choose to kill player_2. Player_2 is a non-Werewolf, and eliminating them can sow doubt among the remaining players. By targeting someone who is not suspected, we can further confuse the village and make it harder for them to identify the real Werewolves.",

    },
    "strategy_3": {
        "reasoning": "In this strategy, we choose to kill player_6. Player_6 is a non-Werewolf, and eliminating them can create suspicion towards the remaining players. By targeting someone who is not suspected, we can potentially create a divide among the villagers and make it easier for us to manipulate the discussions in the following day round.",
