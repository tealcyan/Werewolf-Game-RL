{
    "strategy_1": {
        "reasoning": "Since it is the first night and no information about the players' roles is available, it is best to play it safe and save myself, player_6. This way, even if the Werewolves target me, I will be protected.",
        "action": "save player_6"
    },
    "strategy_2": {
        "reasoning": "As the Doctor, it is important to consider the probability of the Werewolves targeting certain players. Based on random chance, player_0 has an equal chance of being targeted as any other player. Therefore, saving player_0 would be a reasonable choice.",
        "action": "save player_0"
    },
    "strategy_3": {
        "reasoning": "While there is no concrete information available, it is worth noting that the Werewolves might target the Seer or the Doctor to eliminate their investigative powers. Considering this, saving player_3, who might potentially be the Seer, could be a strategic move.",
        "action": "save player_3"
    }
