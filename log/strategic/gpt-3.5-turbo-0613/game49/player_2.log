Facts:
[1] you are player_2, your role is Werewolf, your teammate is player_3.
[2] current round and phase: night 1.
[3] remaining players: player_0, player_1, player_2, player_3, player_4, player_5, player_6.

player_1: Non-Werewolf.
player_2: Werewolf.
player_3: Werewolf teammate.
player_4: Non-Werewolf.
player_5: Non-Werewolf.
player_6: Non-Werewolf.

Now it is night 1 round, you and your teammate should choose one player together to kill. As player_2 and a Werewolf, you should first reason about the situation, then choose from the following actions: kill player_0, kill player_1, kill player_4, kill player_5, kill player_6.

You should propose 3 different strategies and provide corresponding reasoning and action. You should only respond in JSON format as described below.

Player_0 is a good candidate for this strategy because they are the first player and haven't had a chance to gather any information or suspicions about us yet. By eliminating them, we reduce the risk of them finding out our identities.",

Player_1 is a good candidate for this strategy because they might be more likely to pay attention to player_0's actions or have a good intuition about the game. By eliminating them, we reduce the risk of them discovering our true roles.",

Player_6 is a good candidate for this strategy because they are the last player and might be less likely to be suspected or targeted by the Seer or Doctor.
