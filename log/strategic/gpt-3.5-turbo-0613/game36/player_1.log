{
    "strategy_1": {
        "reasoning": "Based on the information given, I have no reason to suspect any specific player. Therefore, I will save myself, player_1, as a precautionary measure.",
        "action": "save player_1"
    },
    "strategy_2": {
        "reasoning": "Since I have no information about the other players' roles, I will choose to save player_0. It is a random choice, but it might help us keep a potential ally alive.",

    },
    "strategy_3": {
        "reasoning": "Although I have no information about the other players' roles, I will save player_6 as a strategic move. By saving the last player in the order, we can potentially maximize the chances of keeping a crucial role alive.",
