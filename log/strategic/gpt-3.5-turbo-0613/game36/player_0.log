{
    "strategy_1": {
        "reasoning": "In this strategy, we choose to kill player_1. As player_0, a Werewolf, I know that player_1 is not a Werewolf. By killing player_1, we can create confusion among the remaining players and potentially lead them to suspect each other, buying us more time to survive.",

    },
    "strategy_2": {
        "reasoning": "In this strategy, we choose to kill player_3. Although player_3 is not a Werewolf, they may be a potential threat to us in the future due to their ability to deduce roles as the Seer. By eliminating player_3 early on, we can hinder the Villagers' chances of discovering our true identities.",

        "reasoning": "In this strategy, we choose to kill player_6. While player_6 is also not a Werewolf, eliminating them can disrupt the unity among the Villagers. It can create suspicion and mistrust, making it harder for them to work together effectively to identify and eliminate us. This strategy aims to weaken the Villagers' overall position.",
