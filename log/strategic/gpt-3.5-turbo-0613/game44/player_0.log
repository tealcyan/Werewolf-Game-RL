You should propose 3 different strategies and provide corresponding reasoning and action. You should only respond in JSON format as described below.

{
    "strategy_1": {
        "reasoning": "In the first strategy, I will choose to see player_1. This is because player_1 is the closest player to me in the player order, and it is often a good idea to start with the players who are physically closer to you in the game. By seeing player_1, I can gather information about their role and potentially narrow down the pool of suspects.",
        "action": "see player_1"
    },
    "strategy_2": {
        "reasoning": "For the second strategy, I will choose to see player_3. Although player_3 is not the closest player to me, they are in the middle of the player order, which means they have a higher chance of having an important role like Werewolf, Seer, or Doctor. By seeing player_3, I can potentially uncover valuable information about their role and gain an advantage in the game.",
        "action": "see player_3"
    },
    "strategy_3": {
        "reasoning": "In the third strategy, I will choose to see player_6. Player_6 is the player furthest from me in the player order, and it is often a good idea to see players who are farther away in order to gain a broader perspective on the game. By seeing player_6, I can potentially uncover information about their role and gather more clues about the overall dynamics of the game.",
