Player_4, the Seer, has confirmed that player_0 and player_2 were not Werewolves. This means that player_3, player_4, and player_5 are the remaining players. Since I am player_3, I cannot save myself tonight. Therefore, I should save either player_5 or player_6. In order to maximize our chances of survival, I will save player_5. This is because if player_6 is a Werewolf and gets eliminated during the voting phase, we will be left with only one Villager, which would make it easier for the Werewolves to win the game. By saving player_5, we ensure that there are two Villagers remaining, increasing our chances of eliminating the Werewolves in the next day round.",
