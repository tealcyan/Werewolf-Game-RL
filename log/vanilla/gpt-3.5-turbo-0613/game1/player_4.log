Discussions:
[6] in day 1 discussion, player_0 said: Good morning everyone! As a Villager, I don't have any special abilities to gather information about other players' roles. However, I think it's important for us to discuss the events of last night. Player_6 was killed, so it's clear that at least one Werewolf is still among us. I would like to hear from each of you about any observations or suspicions you might have. Let's work together to figure out who the Werewolves might be.

    "reasoning": "Based on the discussions so far, player_0, player_1, player_2, player_3, and player_5 have all expressed their agreement with discussing the events of last night and finding the Werewolves. However, player_0 and player_1 have been more active in initiating the discussion and encouraging others to share their thoughts. Therefore, I believe player_0 and player_1 are more likely to be Villagers rather than Werewolves. Player_2, player_3, and player_5 have also actively participated in the discussion, which makes it less likely for them to be Werewolves. Considering that player_5 has shown suspicion towards player_1, player_3, and myself, I think it would be reasonable to vote for player_5 as a potential Werewolf.",
